# ManufacTroid
Manufacturing assistance software. Need to predict a cycle time? Done. Need to estimate manufacturing cost? Done. Need to predict 3D printed part strength? Done.

Well eventually. This is the start of software I've wanted to write for a long time. I work in a machine shop, and hopefully this well help spread knowledge and awareness of common manufacturing methods to the public. It'll also help the people where I work do their jobs more efficiently, saving them time to make important decisions.

## Planned Features
1. Prediction and analysis of CNC machining operations
2. Prediction and analysis of additive manufacturing operations
3. Calculations of approximate part strength
4. Ask questions about operations, materials
5. Optimal rates for machining, additive manufacturing
6. Anything else people might need

## Inspiration
This project is inspired by working in a machine shop and asking about common struggles. I basically want to have Machinery's Handbook entirely encompassed in a program form. That book is incredibly thorough, and one day I would like this software to be that as well.
